# OBS Browser Dragging Example

**What:** Drag a webpage, direct into OBS. Pre-defined sizes, pre-defined names.

**Why:** Adding overlays can require a lot of effort. Let's make it easier.

**How**: This uses an experimental branch, with some extra code of my own. [Available here](https://github.com/WizardCM/obs-studio/commits/drag-drop-urls).
